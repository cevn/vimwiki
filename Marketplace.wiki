1. Merge BSP and CSP code
2. Decide on MFA method

== Merge == 
  * Surprisingly difficult, due to old version of git
  * Recourses: merge on CSP laptop, or merge in cygwin

== MFA ==
  * To use API umbrella method probably have to rip out old auth mechanism
  * Gem is called omniauth-openam and depends on omniauth gem which in turn depends on devise
  * So I will probably have to use to using devise in MP for auth
